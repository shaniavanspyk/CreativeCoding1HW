There are multiple things that I was thinking of doing. I’m either going to put a website together that has multiple aspects to it. Kind of like our website we worked on in html or I was thinking of doing an art piece whether that was a viewing or an interactive one.Those were my main ones that I was thinking of but I also think it would be cool to do a game but I think I’m leaning more towards the website.
