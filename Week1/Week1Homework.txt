Command Line Interface(CLI) is way different from Graphical User Interface(GUI). This is really my second time using CLI as I only worked on some in a multimedia class.
 Although CLI and CUI both involve computers from my experience so far they are very different but definitely have their perks. CLI is a new way of looking at your computer.
 It has all these commands that you can find just by typing out help, finding a variety of things you could try.
  I also found out that it is a great tool to find what could be happening with your computer system by commands. 
Although the CLI uses a lot of wording and not any visual aids like GUI I feel like although it is probably of how much information CLI uses.
 Also CLI focuses more on one topic at a time where GUI allows more tasks to be open.
 I feel like at the moment I like GUI as it is something I’m used to but also it’s been fun so far to find all these new commands with CLI and what cool things can be done with it! 
There’s still a lot I have to learn especially since I’m a beginner and there’s so much information with CLI it seems like and it will definitely be a resource I will use in the future.
